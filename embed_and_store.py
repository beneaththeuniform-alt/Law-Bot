"""
Embed law sections and store them in a local vector database
---------------------------------------------------------------
Reads the section-level JSON produced by law_text_to_json.py, turns each
section's text into an embedding (a list of numbers representing its
meaning), and stores it in a local Chroma database on disk.

This is what lets your bot later find "which sections are relevant to
this question" by MEANING, not just by keyword matching.

Install (one-time):
    pip install chromadb sentence-transformers

Usage:
    python embed_and_store.py output.json

You can run this on EACH Act's JSON file separately — everything gets
added to the same local database (in a folder called chroma_db/), so your
bot can search across all Acts you've added so far.
